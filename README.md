# Breezy_Logs

## What is it?

There was a script request made in Viper Development's discord server, the client wanted connection logs for FiveM. I decided to take on the task and create this script. I plan to add on to this script frequently as far as logs for FiveM so stay on the lookout for updates!

## Configuration

I wanted to make this script easily configurable so I included a config file.

The following can be found in the ``config.lua`` file.

```
	all = "", -- All logs, will contain logs for all webhooks.
	connectionlogs = "", -- Logs connections
	cwebhookcolor = "65280", -- Add a custom color to your embed. It's set to Green by default.
	disconnectionlogs = "", -- Logs disconnections
	dwebhookcolor = "16711680", -- Add a custom color to your embed. It's set to Red by default
```
